Git is a software that helps in Version Controlling System. It is basically a Distributive vcs. It helps for local vcs.
Git is a free and open-source version control system that allows developers to track changes made to their code.
Apache SVN is a centralised VCS. It helps for both local and remote. Pushes changes directly to remote repo.
1) git init
As soon as we initialise git, there are 3 areas: Working, Staging and Commit area.
The files which come to staging area get committed.
2) git status
It shows the status of the files whether they are tracked or untracked.
3) git add <file name>
Adds files that require to be committed.
4) git commit -m "message"
This commits the changes done to the file in the commit area.
-> [git commit -am "message"] This directly commits the file to commit area without staging area.
5) git log This shows all changes done.
6) git config --global alias.<newcommand> <oldcommand>
7) git show <SHA || ID>

Reset:-
    command - git reset --hard <SHA || ID>. This will revert all changes done after the commit of the input SHA ID.
Revert:-
    command - git revert <SHA || ID>. This will revert only oppose the changes done to a specific commit of the input SHA ID.

Branch:-
    It is the new work area, aside from the master branch that contains all the updates of master and won't affect the master branch.
    command:- git branch "branch name"
    How to name: reason/component Eg - bug-fix/navbar
To rename a branch, you have to be in the branch to rename it.
command- git branch -M "name"
To move to the new branch:
    git checkout <brannchname>
    git switch <branchname>
To create and move to a new branch:
    git checkout -b "branchname"
    git switch -c "branchname"
    To delete a branch: git branch -D "branchname"
To merge a branch:
    git merge <branchname>
    Always secondary into primary, i.e., you have to be in primary branch to merge the secondary branch.
    Scene1 = Performed actions only in one of the branches.
    Scene2 = Perform actions in both branches, on different files.
        ORT Strat is used when SCENE2 Merge is used.
    Scene3 = Perform actions in both branches and on same files.
