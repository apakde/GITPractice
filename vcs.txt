1) git init
As soon as we initialise git, there are 3 areas: Working, Staging and Commit area.
The files which come to staging area get committed.
2) git status
It shows the status of the files whether they are tracked or untracked.
3) git add <file name>
Adds files that require to be committed.
4) git commit -m "message"
This commits the changes done to the file in the commit area.
-> [git commit -am "message"] This directly commits the file to commit area without staging area.
5) git log This shows all changes done.
